2018-10-03 not working. all others produced plots fine.
^ realized that there is no wind data for that date.

2018-10-13 is weird: corrected winds are larger, and the windrose directions are not flipped compared to airport data.
wonder if there is inconsistency in reporting "from" vs "to" winds between datasets??
